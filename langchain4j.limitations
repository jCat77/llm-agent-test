1. do not exists functionality about user message history at all

    "LangChain4j currently offers only "memory", not "history".
    If you need to keep an entire history, please do so manually."

2. do not have persistence chat memory impl by default, only in-memory.

    "If persistence is required, a custom ChatMemoryStore can be implemented
    to store ChatMessages in any persistent store of your choice."
